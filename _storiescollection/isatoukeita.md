	 The economic management and sciences students association is one of the very few associations that I have come in personal contact with something that I will never live to regret.
	 </p>

	  <p>
	  As a journalist and a student of the University of the Gambia,my first outside visit with University students was possible thanks to the opportunity given to me by ECOMANSA. 
    </p>
	  <p>
	  It is one such organization whoose members and executives in particular have the welfare of students at heart. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Their role in bringing unionism amongst students is one that can be transmitted across the general student body.I am so love their leadership qualities in their communication with student and the quest to transfer the course of learning beyond the four corners of the classroom.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  One thing that I believe could strengthen the association and take it further is to maintain the issue of togetherness and respect for each other's opinion.if their is anything that I could take or I have learnt from them is patience.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  handling a group is really difficult especially adults,but the maturity and patience shown by ECOMANSA executive is one that I really appreciate. i really look up to this association.
