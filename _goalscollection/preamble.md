     We recognized that the University is an
    assemblage of scholars, endeavoring to broaden their scope in all spheres
    of human dimension.  Therefore we join in that drive, by recognizing
    ourselves through the conceptualization and creation of an association. In
    the above secret spirit, we pledge our firm allegiance in nation building to

    true.
